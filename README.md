# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# React Props and Components

Although this is a simple project,I used this project to understand how you can create one React component and then pull in unique information from a data file or API and .map over it and use props to make each component from another. 

# Deploying the project on Netlify
Run NPM build and take the distribution folder and then drop it into Netlify to publish!!
